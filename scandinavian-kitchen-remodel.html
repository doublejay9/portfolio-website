      <h2 id="top">Scandinavian Kitchen Remodel</h2>
      <p>Honey Construction in Glenarm, Washington, can transform your kitchen with a Scandinavian kitchen remodel. Scandinavia's warmer, more inviting interpretation of minimalism is inspiring more and more American homeowners to turn away from the sleek and sterile kitchens featured in contemporary design magazines. The emphasis on functionality and efficiency makes it an excellent design basis for remodeling small kitchens. As a custom home builder with dozens of kitchen remodels in our portfolio, our crew has the skills and expertise to bring your vision to life and get the job done right.</p>
      <p><b>What is Hygge?</b></p>
      <p>When English-speaking kitchen design experts talk about Scandinavian style, they're referring to Hygge -- a design movement that began in Denmark in the 50s and spread to the rest of Scandinavia and Iceland. You can think of it as a European variation of mid-century modern, and the two designs share plenty of visual similarities. However, Hygge is less about replicating a particular look and more about evoking a specific feeling -- a blend of simplicity, warmth, and togetherness.</p>
      <p><b>Elements of Scandinavian Style</b></p>
      <p>If you want to understand Scandinavian style, you need to understand the environment and culture it comes from. Scandinavian cultures prize sustainability and efficiency, so you see a lot of natural accents and very few frills in their homes. It's cold there, so creating visual warmth inside is a high priority. Scandinavian countries receive abundant natural light in the summer and almost none in the winter. Thus, it's common for buildings to have many windows and extensive indoor lighting that approximates natural light as closely as possible.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple work areas are laid out to maximize efficiency and accessibility.</li>
        <li>Plenty of windows, solar tubes, and skylights leverage natural lighting.</li>
        <li>Ambient, safety, and task lighting are equipped with bulbs that shine warm light.</li>
        <li>Cabinets, counters, and furniture have straight, clean lines.</li>
        <li>Wood flooring, exposed brick and stonework add warmth and texture.</li>
        <li>Kitchens are designed around a neutral/muted color palette. White-on-white and wood-on-white are the most common.</li>
        <li>Bright, warm colors make fabrics and upholstery pop.</li>
      </ul>
