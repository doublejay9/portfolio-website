      <h2 id="top">Buy a New Home & Rent Out the Old One</h2>
      <p>Wooddew Property Management has the best advice in Bardford, Maryland, on how to buy a new home and rent out the old one. You might think that all you need to do is move out and plant a "For Rent" sign in your front yard. However, new landlords often make costly mistakes that ruin their dreams of earning money from their old home. Our team of experienced Bardford real estate agents and property managers can guide you around these common pitfalls and maximize your investment.</p>
      <p><b>The Benefits of Renting</b></p>
      <p>If you're already thinking of moving, there are several reasons why should rent out your Bardford home instead of selling it. Here are a few of the most significant benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One of the easiest ways to become a landlord is to rent a second home.</li>
        <li>Getting your investment property is no more complicated than buying a new home.</li>
        <li>Tenants help you cover your second mortgage.</li>
        <li>You earn extra monthly income.</li>
        <li>Rental property is an excellent investment for retirement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Before You Put Your House Up for Rent</b></p>
      <p>Before you pick up a "For Rent" sign from the nearest store, you should learn if your current mortgage will allow you to convert your home into a investment property. Some mortgages require a waiting period, paying a penalty, or refinancing into a more expensive type of loan. Read your mortgage carefully or contact your lender, so you know what is and isn't allowed.</p>
      <p>You should also research the going rent for a house like yours in your area. It's wise to talk with a local property manager at this point. She will have vast, current knowledge of the rental market and can tell you what rent landlords with similar properties are receiving.</p>
      <p>Now that you know how much rent you can charge, you should subtract your carrying costs from that number to calculate how much income you will be earning. These carrying costs include all of the expenses of owning a house: mortgage payments, property taxes, utilities, homeowner's association dues, pest control, yard work, etc. You should factor in landlord's insurance because bad tenants can damage your house and create a huge liability. Doing this math will give you an objective sense of how much renting out your home will be worth, enabling you to make educated investment decisions.</p>
      <p><b>Before You Buy a Second House</b></p>
      <p>When it comes to buying a second house, consult with a lender about whether you can afford the second house and keep the old one as a rental. Ask for a preapproval letter that will show you the maximum amount you can borrow. This letter won't just help you shop for a home in your price range, but it will make you more attractive to sellers. They might be willing to take a lower offer if you have your mortgage squared away first.</p>
      <p><b>How a Property Manager Can Help</b></p>
      <p>House rental management can be overwhelming for new landlords. With the never-ending list of small tasks, it can feel like death by a thousand papercuts.</p>
