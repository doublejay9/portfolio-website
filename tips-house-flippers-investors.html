      <h2 id="top">Property Management Tips for House Flippers & Investors</h2>
      <p>At Wooddew Property Management, we want to help all of our Bardford and Maryland landlords get the most out of their properties, so we've put together a list of property management tips for house flippers and investors. Whether you're committed to a long-term investment or you want to get the most out of something temporary, our team has the resources and experience to help you achieve your goals.</p>
      <p><b>What Do House Flippers and Investors Have in Common?</b></p>
      <p>Traditional real estate investing is about buying and holding properties to make money over time; flipping houses is all about selling the property (and making a profit) as quickly as possible. However, full-time flippers often own rental properties to generate additional, passive income. Sometimes, sales in a neighboorhood taper off, and the flipper finds herself holding the property. Renting the house can help her earn money while she waits for the market to pick up again.</p>
      <p><b>What's Involved in Property Management?</b></p>
      <p>First and foremost, you'll need to read up on and follow all of Maryland's landlord-tenant laws. One of these legal obligations is to maintain the property, or more likely, regularly hire contractors and tradespeople to make repairs. You also have to pay taxes on your property. This can get complicated fast, so talk with an accountant who specializes in property investments.</p>
      <p>Beyond the law, you want to keep your tenants happy so they will continue renting from you. Simply responding to requests promptly goes a long way. You always want to screen your tenants thoroughly, but it's vital when you have multiple tenants living on the same property. You want someone who is not only responsible but will make a good neighbor for your current tenants, so everyone will be happy to stay long-term.</p>
      <p><b>Why Hire a Property Manager?</b></p>
      <p>While property management tips like these can help you get started, you'll reach a point where hiring a professional property manager makes more sense than continuing on your own.
