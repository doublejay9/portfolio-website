      <h2 id="top">Environmental Inspections for Property Managers</h2>
      <p>Prime Environmental Consulting, based in Daemarrel, Iowa, provides environmental inspections for residential and commercial property managers. Every property manager has a lot on her plate, but keeping your rental house, apartment complex, or office building clean should be a priority. Otherwise, the damage will be expensive for your reputation and your bottom line. Our team can help you avoid liability and stress by uncovering hidden problems within the walls, pipes, and HVAC systems.</p>
      <p><b>A Property Manager's Responsibility</b></p>
      <p>One of a property manager's most important duties is to maintain a healthy place for your tenants to live or work. If you neglect this, you put your tenants at risk for (potentially severe) health problems. At best, they will give you more headaches with complaints that the building is making them sick. At worst, environmental issues will be grounds for lawsuits and result in costly repairs and lawyers' fees.</p>
      <p>Bringing in an environmental consulting firm for regular inspections can help you avoid and resolve issues before they spiral out of control. Here are some of the hazards our team is equipped to test.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asbestos</li>
        <li>Bacteria</li>
        <li>Heavy Metals</li>
        <li>Lead</li>
        <li>Mold</li>
        <li>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>What We Provide</b></p>
      <p>Our environmental consultants perform building inspections to ensure that your property is compliant with local environmental laws. If problems come up, we provide thorough testing to get a full picture of what's happening. We'll walk you through the results and give expert recommendations on the next steps.
