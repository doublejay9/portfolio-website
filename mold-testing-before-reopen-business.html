      <h2 id="top">Mold Testing Before Reopening Your Business</h2>
      <p>Before you reopen your business in Chalques, California, call Strawic Environmental Engineering for mold testing. The 2020 COVID-19 lockdown forced numerous commercial buildings to stop operations, leading to a reduction in cleaning, maintenance, water, and equipment use. Sudden halts like this can create hazards to returning workers and patrons (runaway mold among them) that require professional inspection to solve completely.</p>
      <p><b>Mold Grows During Shutdowns</b></p>
      <p>Mold will grow wherever moisture collects: ceiling tiles, fabric, wallpaper, insulation, carpet, drywall, etc. It's often fed by leaks in pipes, windows, or roofs. Naturally, people with a mold allergy should stay away, but mold can also aggravate those with respiratory conditions (like asthma) and weakened immune systems.</p>
      <p>Mold will spread to a dangerous degree if left unchecked for a prolonged time. Whether that extended period is defined in days or weeks depends on the season, climate, and building-specific factors. If your building is in a humid area and has poor ventilation, mold needs only a few days to spiral out of hand, but it will take a week or more to spread that far in a well-ventilated building in dry weather.</p>
      <p><b>Who Should Consider a Mold Inspection?</b></p>
      <p>Any business can suffer from mold issues, though ones that generally use a significant amount of water daily run a higher risk from leaks and standing water that developed during a shutdown. Mold hits businesses in the food and beverage and health and wellness industries especially hard. It's also wise to take extra health precautions if your company serves vulnerable populations, like children or senior citizens.</p>
