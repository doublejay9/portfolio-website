      <h2 id="top">Benefits of Using a General Contractor for Your Commercial Construction Projects</h2>
      <p>Bridgelight is a California general contractor who oversees commercial and industrial construction projects around the Yunares and Hilwick County areas. It's tempting for business owners to hire cheap labor as a way to cut construction costs, but the results usually turn into nightmares. When it comes to industrial or commercial projects, you need a seasoned general contractor, like Bridgelight, on your side to help realize your vision and see the job through.</p>
      <p><b>What is a General Contractor?</b></p>
      <p>A general contractor leads, manages, and coordinates all aspects of a construction or remodeling project. She is in charge of the paperwork and scheduling, ensuring each step of the process is completed efficiently and on time. The contractor can also leverage her professional connections -- designers, architects, manufacturers, suppliers, sub-contractors -- to get you the best quality work for the best price.</p>
      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>
      <p>In the long run, hiring a commercial construction company is a very cost-effective decision. The range of benefits they provide is surprisingly broad.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Commercial contractors know the local building codes and construction laws, so you don't have to worry about them.</li>
        <li>Construction companies are legally bonded, and their work is covered by warranty, meaning the results will meet building standards and your expectations.</li>
        <li>With their connections, general contractors can get discounts on nearly everything the project needs: permits, equipment, materials, labor, etc.</li>
        <li>They can handle multiple tasks in a single project, like replacing the floors and repairing a roof.</li>
        <li>Good management ensures that the project is completed on schedule and budget.</li>
        <li>General contractors offer single-source accountability and communication.</li>
        <li>General contractors relieve their clients of accident liability if a sub-contractor gets injured on the job, sparing you potential financial burden and stains on your business' reputation.</li>
        <li>Constant evaluation of work enables them to complete a project with minimal revisions and delays.</li>
        <li>Because of her expertise and years of experience, a general contractor can quickly resolve issues without disrupting the crew's workflow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At Bridgelight, we've built our reputation on over five decades of excellence with numerous industry awards as proof of our team's skills. Our staff includes contractors as well as designers and project managers. By keeping so much of the building process in-house, we can offer our clients true conception to completion service.</p>
      <p><b>Pros and Cons of Not Hiring a Commercial Contractor</b></p>
      <p>You're probably still wondering if hiring a commercial building contractor is a worthwhile investment, or if it would make more sense to do it yourself. It's your property, so you could take control of the construction project if you wanted to. But just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.</p>
      <p>If you're planning a small upgrade with minor construction work, you probably don't need the full suite of services that a general contractor provides. It'd be more economical to take a DIY approach or hire a local handyman. However, it's illegal in some areas to do any commercial construction without a contractor, so be sure to double-check what you're allowed to do before you pick up that hammer.</p>
      <p>Doing commercial construction yourself (even where it's legal) doesn't exempt you from building codes. Not adhering to them can pose serious health, safety, and legal risks for you, your employees, and your customers. There's also the high expenses and lost revenue to worry about should those risks ever turn into disasters.</p>
