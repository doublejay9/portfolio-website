      <h2 id="top">Poor Air Quality at the Office</h2>
      <p>Prime Environmental Consulting in Daemarrel, Iowa, provides businesses with air quality testing that checks for poor air quality at the office. Though it's not an obvious hazard, air quality at work can have a significant impact on your employees' health. What starts as stuffiness and a weird odor could lead to severe structural damage, workers being too sick to come into the office, and a considerable loss in revenue. If you've noticed a drop in productivity and morale and an increase in health complaints from your staff, contact us to schedule a building inspection.</p>
      <p><b>Causes of Indoor Air Pollution</b></p>
      <p>Many things can result in poor indoor air quality. Some are the by-products of a typical workday: cleaning products, copy machines, restroom air fresheners, and tobacco smoke, for example. Others are fumes and contaminants from one area of the building -- a dumpster, boiler room, print shop, or underground parking garage -- leaking into your usual workspace. Standing water in air conditioners, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and cooling towers grow fungi and bacteria which can spread around the building through the ventilation system.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Poor ventilation</li>
        <li>Poor air circulation</li>
        <li>Poorly-maintained HVAC systems</li>
        <li>Moisture from leaks, flooding, or high humidity</li>
        <li>Construction/remodeling work inside or nearby</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Sick Building Syndrome</b></p>
      <p>Workers can and do develop serious health problems from the office environments they work in. Cases of asthma and certain strains of pneumonia can be traced back to causes within the building.</p>
      <p>Many times, however, the symptoms that employees experience aren't as severe, which can make tracing the source harder. If the symptoms only appear at the office and disappear once you leave the building, then it's called sick building syndrome. It's also a sign that you ought to investigate the building for possible causes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Burning throat</li>
        <li>Dizziness</li>
        <li>Dry eyes</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Forgetfulness</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Irritability</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Sneezing</li>
        <li>Stuffy or runny nose</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>How Poor Air Quality Hurts Your Bottom Line</b></p>
      <p>It's common business sense that sick workers aren't at their best, so they can't do their best work. Whether psychological symptoms plague them or they're distracted by physical ones, their productivity will drop. An employee affected by sick building syndrome will call in sick more often and for more extended periods to regain her strength before returning to struggle against the office building itself. The longer your employees can't work, the more profits your business loses.</p>
      <p>Putting off repairs, turning off a deteriorated HVAC system, and blocking vents might provide short-term cost savings and relief from odors, but it will hurt you, your workers, and your bottom line in the long-term. Hiring an environmental consulting firm, like Prime Environmental Consulting, can help you improve your workplace by uncovering hidden problems and determining the causes behind the health complaints. Our inspectors will explain the results of all tests they'll perform in your building and give you expert recommendations on what you should do to correct any issues they find.</p>
