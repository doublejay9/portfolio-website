      <h2 id="top">Game Room Remodel</h2>
      <p>Rinow Design & Build is a construction company that remodels game rooms and home theaters for families in Solicuaro and Solicuaro County, Arizona. A game room can be a place to spend hours of fun with family and friends or a private escape where you can unwind after a stressful day. Whether you're into sports, movies, video games, or board games, our designers and construction crew can help turn your vision into a reality.</p>
      <p><b>Game Room Ideas</b></p>
      <p>A game room is a custom space designed around your favorite activities. Your "game room" could take the form of an adults-only lounge for pool and poker, a kids' playroom, or a home theater the whole family can enjoy. The thing that unites all of these ideas is the desire to create a dedicated hang-out space you can enjoy with your guests (or by yourself) without disturbing other family members.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install a built-in entertainment center that's ready for a TV, speakers, media players, and video game consoles.</li>
        <li>Have comfortable seating, including extra that you can pull out for larger-than-normal gatherings.</li>
        <li>Build plenty of shelving to keep board games and game books.</li>
        <li>Install plenty of task, accent, and ambient lighting so everyone can see and to tie the room together.</li>
        <li>Add a bar for drinks, snacks, and a touch of luxury.</li>
        <li>Add storage for the extra things your games may need: additional controllers, decks of cards, dice, paper, pencils, etc.</li>
        <li>Install soundproofing to minimize noise leaking into the rest of the house.</li>
        <li>For playrooms, integrate kid-friendly elements like big windows, indoor slide or swing, a climbing wall, and chalkboard wall.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What makes a truly epic game room is a space that reflects your personality and design tastes, whether modern, traditional, or contemporary. Without a consistent theme, the room will feel bland. The room will also feel disconnected if the game room design doesn't get with the rest of your home.</p>
      <p><b>What We Offer</b></p>
      <p>Remodels are bigger projects than they might sound, whether you're giving your current game room a makeover or transforming a room into your new home theater. More often than not, the project will require skills that your average handyman doesn't have. This is especially true for garage, attic, or basement game rooms where you're starting with a blank slate.</p>
      <p>At Rinow Design & Build, we have the expertise and professional connections to lay the structural foundation for an awesome game room, billiards room, sports lounge, or home theater. As your general contractor, we'll worry about coordinating the electricians, painters, and flooring companies. You can rest assured that we'll finish the remodel on time and budget.</p>
