      <h2 id="top">5 Reasons to Build a Custom Multigenerational Home</h2>
      <p>Honey Construction build custom multigenerational homes in Glenarm, Washington, and we've compiled five reasons to consider one for your family. The past decade has seen a steady rise in the number of multigenerational homes in America, and those numbers continue to rise. Whether out of necessity or choice, more and more homeowners are turning to multigenerational home builders to help them fit more family members under the same roof without sacrificing flexibility, freedom, and privacy.</p>
      <p><b>What is a Multigenerational Home?</b></p>
      <p>The US Census Bureau defines a multigenerational home as a household with more than two adult generations living under the same roof or grandparents living with grandchildren who are under 25 years old. For home builders, it means a structure that occupies an architectural middle ground between a single-family house and a multi-family building.</p>
      <p>Multi-gen homes often center around communal spaces, like a great room and a large kitchen that bring everyone together. Private suites offer each generation -- parents with young children, grandparents, adult children, etc. -- independence and quiet time to ensure harmony. These suites can include more than just a bedroom and bathroom, but also a private sitting room, separate outdoor entrance, and a small kitchen to make it feel like an apartment.</p>
      <p><b>Benefits of Living in a Multi-Gen Home</b></p>
      <p>The emotional benefits that come from multiple generations living together can't be measured or quantified. There are also some appealing, practical benefits that can save your family money, time, and stress.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Generations can pool resources and share expenses.</li>
        <li>Seeing each other every day will strengthen family relationships, which can improve a grandparent's quality of life.</li>
        <li>You have natural security, since a multi-gen home is rarely unoccupied for long, and family members can help the elderly if they hae an accident.</li>
        <li>Self-contained suites help family members maintain independence, privacy, and self-worth.</li>
        <li>You can split chores among more people. Some family members can take care of yard work and physically demanding tasks while others pitch in with child care, laundry, and cooking.</li>
      </ol>
