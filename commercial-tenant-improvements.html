      <h2 id="top">Commercial Tenant Improvements</h2>
      <p>Before you start planning your business' grand opening in San Jose or San Francisco, California, call Aeyo Construction to handle your commercial tenant improvements. Your commercial unit is more than a place to work; it can be a second home for you, your employees, and your regulars. Our tenant finishing services will transform a bare room into the ideal space for your Bay Area business.</p>
      <p><b>What are Tenant Improvements?</b></p>
      <p>Many new commercial buildings are left as empty shells, with each rental unit consisting of four walls, a couple of doors and windows, and unfinished floors and ceilings. Without interior walls, plumbing, electrical, and other finishing work, it's not a complete building, meaning you're not ready for business. That's where remodeling companies like Aeyo Construction can help.</p>
      <p>Tenant improvements (TI) are building alterations done to a rented space to serve the tenant's needs better. You'll often hear commercial contractors call the entire TI project a "buildout." These improvements range from installing new electrical outlets and energy-efficient lighting to a complete interior overhaul.</p>
      <p><b>Businesses That Need Tenant Buildouts</b></p>
      <p>The space that welcomes clients and customers as they walk in your front door is a visual statement about who you are and your services' quality. Your business deserves a look and feel that reflects your core values. When you create an inviting space that perfectly aligns with what you do, you'll draw in more customers, give your employees a better work experience, and add long-term value to your business.</p>
      <p>Without interior enhancements to make the unit your own, it won't serve your business. Your employees need space that functions well and meets the demands of your industry. Top-tier construction companies will listen to what all of your employees require from their workplace -- both public-facing and behind the scenes -- so your entire team can perform at their best.</p>

      <p><b>Our Tenant Improvement Contracting Services</b></p>
      <p>The specific alterations you choose will depend on your business needs and the current state of your unit. If someone previously occupied it, the former tenants may have left behind a few gifts, or what's there is such a poor fit for your business that you're better off tearing it out and starting over from scratch.
