      <h2 id="top">Benefits of Using a Property Management Company</h2>
      <p>Landlords in Bardford, Maryland, can enjoy all of the benefits of using a property management company by partnering with Wooddew Property Management. Owning rental property is an excellent source of income, but it also comes with added responsibilities: upkeep, repairs, marketing, etc. Whether you're new to house rental management or an experienced landlord, our team can give you and your property several advantages over the rest of the market.</p>
      <p><b>What Property Managers Do</b></p>
      <p>A property management company is a group of pros who handle the daily needs of your property and all aspects of the tenant-landlord relationship on your behalf. All we ask for in exchange is a percentage of your monthly rental rate. Our clients say that our services pay for themselves in no time, which means more profits for you to keep.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expense reporting</li>
        <li>Help setting rent and writing leases</li>
        <li>Lease renewal</li>
        <li>Marketing</li>
        <li>Property inspections and maintenance</li>
        <li>Rent collection</li>
        <li>Site evaluation</li>
        <li>Tenant communication (including compliants and maintenance requests)</li>
        <li>Tenant screening</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Types of Property We Manage</b></p>
      <p>Different types of properties have different needs and operate on different rhythms. With a single-family house or townhouse, you're only responding to the needs of a few tenants, but that workload multiplies with condos and apartments. When you start working with us, we'll pair you with a manager who specializes in your type of property and understands its rhythm.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apartment buildings</li>
        <li>Condos</li>
        <li>Duplexes</li>
        <li>Multiplexes</li>
        <li>Single family homes</li>
        <li>Townhouses</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Why Hire a Property Manager?</b></p>
      <p>An apartment property manager's goal is to take the majority of the work off your plate, sparing you headaches and helping you avoid costly mistakes. We train our managers to handle problems quickly and professionally, which helps keep your tenants happy and in place.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Experienced eyes can weed out problem tenants and spot good ones immediately, increasing your odds of landing a reliable renter.</li>
        <li>Property managers know how to handle chronic complainers.</li>
