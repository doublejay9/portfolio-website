      <h2 id="top">Does Homeowner's Insurance Cover Roof Leak Repair?</h2>
      <p>Since Hercule Roofing is one of Bredon, Illinois' top roofing companies, clients ask us all the time if their homeowner's insurance will cover roof leak repairs. Your house is your largest investment, so it's not easy thinking about how something could destroy it in a matter of minutes. When it comes to roof damage, the lines between what insurance will and will not cover can blur, but our experts can help make things clearer.</p>
      <p><b>What Insurance Companies Consider</b></p>
      <p>Roof insurance is part of your homeowner's insurance policy, and it covers your roof in cases where it needs significant repairs or replacement. Generally speaking, insurance will cover a roof leak if the damage was sudden and caused by a circumstance listed in your policy. Fire, vandalism, and extreme weather, like hurricanes and tornadoes, are usually covered.</p>
      <p>Damage that builds over time isn't covered by insurance. This includes natural wear and tear and damage inflicted over many snowy winters. Below are some other factors that can prevent you from receiving insurance coverage.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most insurers won't cover a roof that's over twenty years old.</li>
        <li>If they believe you haven't kept up regular roof maintenance, they will deny your claim.</li>
        <li>They won't cover further repairs if you tried to do it yourself first.</li>
        <li>Many insurers are phasing out coverage for certain types of weather damage, like wind and hail. Check your policy for specifics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The Importance of Regular Roof Maintenance</b></p>
      <p>It's up to the homeowner to maintain her roof and make sure necessary repairs are handled quickly and done well. You should inspect your roof twice a year -- once in the fall and once in the spring -- to find problems early, like broken or worn shingles.</p>
      <p>It's also wise to have professional roof inspections done every few years, depending on the type of roof you have. After your roof turns ten, you may want to schedule these more often. A roofer's trained eye can spot warning signs that you may miss or not recognize.</p>
      <p><b>Our Roof Leak Repair Services</b></p>
      <p>When you schedule an appointment with us, ask your inspector to document your roof's condition with pictures and provide a written, signed evaluation. We're happy to create these reports since they help protect our clients from accusations of poor roof construction or roof neglect if the insurance company ever disputes their claims.</p>
      <p>Besides professional inspections and shingle replacement, we can repair the less visible parts of your roof -- decking, flashing, underlayers, etc. Our varied residential and commercial experience means that we can maintain all kinds of roofs, like wood, slate, metal, and flat roofs. If we find that the damage is too severe, we offer roof replacement and new roof installation.</p>
