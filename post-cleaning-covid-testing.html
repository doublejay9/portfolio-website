      <h2 id="top">Post Cleaning COVID-19 Surface Testing</h2>
      <p>Strawic Environmental Engineering can perform post-cleaning COVID-19 surface testing for businesses and other commercial properties in Chalques, California. Information frequently changes as scientists learn more about the coronavirus -- so much so that it's tough for the average business owner to stay on top of. Our environmental consultants are equipped with up-to-date COVID knowledge and the tools needed to determine if your business is virus-free.</p>
      <p><b>What's Involved</b></p>
      <p>Our COVID-19 surface tests are designed to be conducted after a thorough cleaning and sanitizing by trained professionals. The test's purpose is to make sure the cleanup was successful, and the affected area is safe.</p>
      <p>COVID-19 surface sampling can take as little as a few minutes, depending on the size of the building and area of exposure. We pay particular attention to heavy-use areas, like well-traveled hallways and reception desks.</p>
      <p><b>What We Test</b></p>
      <p>Recent studies suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus stays in the air for up to 30 minutes and survives on hard surfaces for 72 hours or more. Scientists also believe that the virus lives longer on certain fabrics and in moist, humid areas. Below are a few of the surfaces our team can sample.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Appliances</li>
        <li>Computers</li>
        <li>Counters</li>
        <li>Floors</li>
        <li>Knobs</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Why Invest in Surface Testing?</b></p>
      <p>A key benefit of COVID-19 surface testing that shouldn't be understated is that it's an excellent way to keep your employees and clients safe. From a practical standpoint, the test tells you if your cleanup efforts are working. Reliable, effective cleaning procedures minimize the virus' impact on your bottom line by decreasing the time your business must stay closed, and the associated amount of lost revenue.</p>
      <p>Our environmental consultants follow the strict health and safety protocols recommended by the WHO and CDC. We do so to keep ourselves safe and to give you the most accurate results possible. You can rest assured that, once we give you the green light, you don't have any more to worry about.</p>
