      <h2 id="top">4 Things to Consider Before Renting Out Your Denver Condo</h2>
      <p>Our mission at Antelben Property Management is to help Colorado landlords get the most out of their rentals, so we've put together a list of four things to consider before renting out your Denver condo. Renting out a condo is an excellent way to earn extra income, but it's a different process than renting out an apartment and carries a set of various limitations. However, if you can operate within those limitations, then a condo can be a very marketable and relatively worry-free rental.</p>
      <p><b>Condo Rental Challenges</b></p>
      <p>Conventional wisdom is set against condos working well as rentals, mostly because of all of the extra fees: association fees, agency costs, management fees, etc. Dues will eat away at your cash flow, but in a well-run association, you'll get a variety of benefits in return, such as utilities, insurance, and trash collection. You can also pool resources with other condo owners for more extensive repairs and capital projects.</p>
      <p>For landlords, a condo association is a trade-off for fewer maintenance responsibilities in exchange for dealing with a bureaucratic entity. Associations function like small-scale democracies, and its politics can range from mild to boiling. One condominium board can be generally cooperative, while another may have active lawsuits between its members.</p>
      <p><b>4 Things to Consider When Renting Out Your Condo</b></p>
      <p>The first thing we advise prospective condo landlords to do is read through the association's CC&Rs (covenants, conditions, and restrictions). Each condo has its own rules, and the letter and spirit of these rules will determine your ability to rent, under what conditions you can lease, and how profitable your rental can be. These documents will have most of the answers you're looking for as you research your condo's potential as a rental.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Learn about renting and lease restrictions, especially any conditions you must meet as the owner and restrictions that will limit your pool of potential tenants, like age requirements in a senior housing community.</li>
        <li>Find out if your condo is warrantable or non-warrantable. It will influence what kind of mortgage you can get, your interest rate, and how much you will need for a down deposit.</li>
        <li>Does the condo association have monetary reserves? If not, you'll need to set aside funds in case of special assessments.</li>
        <li>Research what property taxes you'll be expected to pay.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>How Condo Property Management Can Help</b></p>
      <p>If you want your condo to be a successful rental, you'll need to do your homework before buying. A key factor will be finding the right condo and a strong association. Another factor will be hiring a knowledgeable and experienced property manager.</p>
      <p>When you partner with a property management company, like Antelben Property Management, you can leverage their professional knowledge of local and neighborhood-specific laws to make the renting process more straightforward. Your property manager also has a toolbox of strategies that will help you get the most out of your condo, even when you have association frees to offset. If your condo is in a senior housing community, there are unique variables you'll need to evaluate during the income verification stage; our property managers have experience screening renters of all ages.</p>
