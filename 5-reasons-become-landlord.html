      <h2 id="top">5 Great Reasons to Become a Landlord</h2>
      <p>At Wooddew Property Management, we love helping first-time real estate investors get their start in Bardford, Maryland, so we've built this list of five great reasons to become a landlord. The internet is full of horror stories about lousy landlords, terrible tenants, and simple mistakes that cost the investor everything. With an apartment property management team guiding you each step of the way, you don't have to worry about those expensive pitfalls.</p>
      <p><b>Before Becoming a Landlord</b></p>
      <p>There are multiple pros and cons you need to consider before deciding to invest in rental properties. Yes, you need to have enough financial resources, but money isn't the only factor at work here.</p>
      <p>When you become a landlord, you become a business owner, precisely one in the real estate industry. A good condo rental management team is a great ally to have, but they shouldn't be your only ally. You'll gain a lot from networking with and learning from others in the field -- bankers, real estate agents, attorneys, and many more. Everyone has stories and wisdom to share.</p>
      <p>As your house rental management partners, we promise to leverage all of our experience and expertise to make being a landlord as stress-free as possible. There will still be ups and downs, but it's a worthwhile journey if you're willing to invest yourself as well as your money into it.</p>
      <p><b>Benefits of Being a Landlord</b></p>
      <p>A thousand small tasks can easily consume a landlord's time -- rent payment reminders, addressing tenant complaints, scheduling maintenance work, etc. When you partner with a good property manager, she will take care of these daily headaches so you can fully enjoy the benefits. Here are the top five advantages of being a landlord.</p>
