      <h2 id="top">Investing in Rental Properties</h2>
      <p>If you want to start investing in rental properties in Bardford, Maryland, count on the real estate agents at Wooddew Property Management to help you find the perfect property. You might be looking for a place you can later resell at a profit. Maybe you want to be the landlord of buy and hold properties. Whatever your investment goals are, our agents can help you buy the house that will get you started.</p>
      <p><b>What Type of Property is Right for a Beginner?</b></p>
      <p>If you're new to real estate investing, starting small -- a single apartment, duplex, or condo -- is best for getting comfortable with the process and your new responsibilities. Unless you're skilled in construction, avoid buildings that need extensive renovations and focus on properties that only need minor repairs. Beyond these basic guidelines, you should identify the kinds of people you want to attract as buyers or tenants and choose rental properties that meet their needs. Our local knowledge of the Bardford area can help you find the right place in the perfect neighborhood for your future buyers or tenants.</p>
      <p><b>How Much Should You Pay?</b></p>
      <p>Always buy below market value to maximize the return on your investment. Most experts recommend buying at 70% market value or less. Keep in mind that investment properties come with higher down payments (at least 20%) and higher property taxes. That's in addition to renovation and operating costs.</p>
      <p>At Wooddew Property Management, we have our ears to the ground with the latest market information. We know what's hot and what's a great deal for first-time investors. We'll help you identify the price point that's right for your budget.</p>
      <p><b>The Value of Teamwork</b></p>
      <p>Owning rental properties can be a source of passive income, but not if you're doing everything yourself. You'll want to establish business relationships with investment property management and maintenance companies who can take most of the work off of your plate. When you partner with Wooddew Property Management, you're getting a team with decades of experience who have the insight you need to make your first investment (or your tenth) a success.</p>
