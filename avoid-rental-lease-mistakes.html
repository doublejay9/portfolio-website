      <h2 id="top">Avoiding Rental Lease Mistakes</h2>
      <p>Wooddew Property Management in Bardford, Maryland, helps landlords write their property leases and avoid rental lease mistakes. There are several factors to consider when filling a vacant rental, yet many landlords don't prioritize their lease highly enough. A rental agreement holds significant legal weight, so call on your property management experts to make sure your lease covers everything you and your tenants need.</p>
      <p><b>How to Avoid Common Rental Agreement Mistakes</b></p>
      <p>Landlords often make lease mistakes when income is low, and they're rushing to fill their vacancies. The more thoroughly you prepare your lease, the better prepared you are when an issue arises. Below is a checklist you can use to avoid the most common rental agreement mistakes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>List the names of each adult occupant in the first paragraph and the signature block.</li>
        <li>Use the tenant's name throughout the agreement in place of the word "tenant."</li>
        <li>Always refer to the tenant by their full legal name in the rental agreement. Ask for their driver's license or another form of official ID that states their legal name.</li>
        <li>Research your local rental market to set an optimal rental rate. Re-evaluate your rate every time you place a new tenant to ensure you're in line with current trends.</li>
        <li>Include a grace period for rent payments, late fees, and an eviction process in case of non-payment.</li>
        <li>Set designated lease start and end dates, as well as how many days' notice the tenant should give you when she wants to move out.</li>
        <li>Personalize your rental agreement by setting specific property rules and outlining the consequences for breaking those rules. Consider making rules addressing maintenance responsibilities, pets, smoking, and interior changes.</li>
        <li>Make sure your lease complies with Maryland landlord-tenant laws to avoid future legal trouble.</li>
        <li>Number pages, including addenda, with "Page X of [total]" so you're less likely to lose or leave out pages.</li>
        <li>Include a cover letter addressed to the tenant that covers important information in plain English so they can better understand what the rental agreement entails.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The Benefits of Working with a Property Manager</b></p>
      <p>State and local realtors' associations often provide universal leases that can be a good starting point, but they can't satisfy every possible type of lease term. There will be specifics that need to be addressed in the lease, whether you have thought of them or not. Our experienced property managers can advise you on what terms you should include in the agreement and translate your concerns into legal language.</p>
