      <h2 id="top">Top 7 Heavy Metal Contaminates to Test</h2>
      <p>If you're concerned about the top seven heavy metal contaminants to test in your soil and water, trust the experts at Brisk Environmental Enigineering in Aynor, Indiana. Everyone became more aware of the dangers of contaminated drinking water when the Flint, Michigan water crisis made national headlines in 2014. Soil can also become contaminated since dust containing heavy metals eventually settles onto residential gardens and the grounds outside your place of business. Having your water and soil professionally inspected will put your mind at ease and help you understand your risk.</p>
      <p><b>Heavy Metals Testing</b></p>
      <p>Heavy metals in water are invisible hazards that can't be seen, smelled, or tasted. While the metals listed below do occur naturally in the soil and water supply, they rarely reach toxic levels. In the next section, we'll name the most common reasons why contamination happens.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arsenic</li>
        <li>Cadmium</li>
        <li>Chromium</li>
        <li>Copper</li>
        <li>Lead</li>
        <li>Manganese</li>
        <li>Nickel</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>How Soil and Water Get Contaminated</b></p>
      <p>High levels of heavy metals in soil, particularly chromium and arsenic, can sometimes be a result of natural erosion. However, human pollution -- dust and runoff from mining, manufacturing, and industry -- is a more likely culprit. Large-scale agriculture also plays a role because the fertilizers and pesticides it uses sink into the soil and drains away with rainwater. Even mundane pollution, like car exhaust and tobacco smoke, can explain how the top layers of soil become contaminated over time.</p>
      <p>Plumbing corrosion is the most common cause of drinking water contamination. Most of us know that lead is a problem in older buildings, specifically those built before 1986. However, newer buildings can suffer copper and manganese contamination as their plumbing ages and degrades.</p>
      <p><b>How Dangerous Are Heavy Metals?</b></p>
      <p>Heavy metal toxicity isn't a simple thing to define. Some heavy metals, like lead and arsenic, are always toxic to humans. Other heavy metals, like manganese and copper, are healthy in small doses, but long-term exposure to high concentrations can cause severe health problems.</p>
      <p>How toxic a specific metal is can also depend on the person. For example, most people can tolerate small doses of nickel, but the NIH estimates that 10-20% of Americans are allergic to nickel.</p>
      <p><b>Signs of Heavy Metal Poisoning</b></p>
      <p>Stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are common symptoms of acute (short-term) heavy metal poisoning. Call a doctor if you or someone in your family suddenly develops these symptoms. Once the doctor confirms that it's heavy metal poisoning, call an environmental testing service, like Brisk Enivornmental Engineering, to assess your home's drinking water or soil. A professional inspection can help you identify the source of the poisoning and better understand what should be done to fix the problem.</p>
