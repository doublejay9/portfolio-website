      <h3 class="first">My Approach to Copywriting</h3>
      <p>Whether they say so or not, every business knows that their offer isn't for every customer all the time. Likewise, every copywriter knows that they aren't the best fit for every writing task. In that spirit, I'd like to elaborate on my approach to copywriting and where I excel. This knowledge can help you judge if the kinds of content I write will benefit your business.</p>
      <p><b>The Explainer</b></p>
      <p><a href="https://radix-communications.com/seven-types-b2b-copywriter-one-best/">A 2013 blog post published by Radix Communications</a> identifies seven types of copywriters, their skillsets, and the kinds of writing tasks that suit them best. I'm an Explainer Copywriter, which the author defines as "someone who knows how to present the logical and rational case for investment in a product or [service], in a way that's clear, digestible and easy to read."</p>
      <p><b>Building Goodwill Through Education</b></p>
      <p>You've heard the old phrase about how much easier it is to catch flies with honey than vinegar. That phrase reflects a psychological truth that is especially relevant to marketing: people are more likely to buy from companies they like and trust. The surest way to build that favorable reputation is to help them first.</p>
      <p>The kind of help I provide is education. Clients often ask me to write informational and advice articles, such as detailing what happens after someone files an OSHA complaint, outlining the causes and warning signs of gum disease, and tips for first-time real estate investors. I can take complex topics and break them down, explaining them to the average reader. Not only do I teach readers something new, helping them better understand the problem they're facing. I raise the chances of those readers becoming future customers.</p>
      <p><b>Appeal to Reason</b></p>
      <p>Conventional marketing wisdom emphasizes the importance and use of tactics that appeal to the audience's emotions. But if you've ever felt drained after listening to yet another heart-tugging story, annoyed after watching a series of silly commercials, or frustrated when a salesperson refuses to give you a straight answer, you've experienced the downside of relying too much on the tactics.</p>
      <p>When people are emotionally drained, they stop caring and paying attention. A marketing strategy that aims for your audience's emotions too hard and too often will, in time, drive prospects away, whether out of apathy, disgust, distrust, or defiant opposition to perceived manipulation.</p>
      <p>I take a different approach when writing content for my clients. When I'm not acting as a teacher, I take on the advocate role and build a rational case for why the reader should do business with you. Walking through the logic will help convince skeptics that there is substance and expertise behind the slick talk they might have heard elsewhere. In the latter stages of your sales process, appealing to reason and presenting evidence -- professional qualifications, examples of past work, a track record of customer satisfaction expressed through testimonials -- will reassure hesitant prospects that they are making a wise financial decision.</p>
      <p><b>Interested?</b></p>
      <p>I can write engaging, informative articles that explain what you do to a wide audience. If you need content to convert skeptical and cautious prospects, I'm on the case. If promotional material written in a more serious tone that appeals to reason best suits your industry and company image, I can help.</p>
